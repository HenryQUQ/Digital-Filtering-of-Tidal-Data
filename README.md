# Digital-Filtering-of-Tidal-Data
Tide is a significant subject in Ocean-dynamics. The velocity of the ocean current involves the tidal data but with high-frequency interference information.
Therefore, we need use filter the interference to get useful tidal data. There are several different ways to do so. In this project, the Discrete Fourier Transform is used, and then a digital filter is used.

ocean.dat file saved the data of the tidal data.

F2_Chenyuan_Qu.py file is the Python code to process the data.

Digital_Filtering_of_Tidal_Data.pdf is the full report for this project.
